In terms of 2022 GBP (henceforth £), UK's average quarterly income has more than tripled from £2543 in the first quarter of 1955 to £8213 in the first quarter of 2023. We can also see that this overall growth has not been smooth - GDP fluctuates around trend over sequential periods of *expansions* and *recessions* - something known as the **business cycle**. For example, in the second quarter of 2020 (the through of the 2020 pandemic recession), per capita GDP fell to £6437 - a level last seen in 1998 - from a peak of £8386 two quarters ago.  \n",

    "One aspect in which time series charts in logs represent information more intuitively than in levels comes from the property, previously discussed, that the difference of the logs of two numbers is approximately equal to the proportional difference between the numbers in levels.

We have already mentioned this, and will return to it later. Another example of how this can be useful can be stated in the context of the above example. As we can see, following the divergence between the actual and counterfactual series around the Great Recession, as of the last quarter of 2019 (just before the Covid pandemic) the difference in logs of the two series was about 0.2[^cost]. This implies that, up to an approximation, UK economy was operating at about 20% lower GDP per capita in 2019 relative to what we would have expected if the pre-Great-Recession trend had persisted. This is one (possibly naive) way to think of the long-term cost of the productivity slowdown. The point here is that this is clearly visible on the chart in logs without further calculations necessary. On the other hand, what we see in the chart in levels is that the level is approximately 1800 pounds less than the trend. While both numbers are informative, the point is that different representations (even of the same variable) make it easier to focus on different aspects.\n",

    "[^cost]: In fact, looking closely at the data, the log of GDP per capita in the last quarter of 2019 was 9.03419 in the actual series and 9.231319 in the counterfactual series - the difference in logs was then about 0.197 (9.231319-9.03419). The corresponding quantities in levels were 8386 for the actual, and 10212 for the counterfactual series. The actual difference in levels was 1826 pounds (10212-8386). The actual percentage difference was  0.217 (1826/8386). You can see that the difference in logs (0.197) is close to the actual percentage difference (0.217) even though 0.217 is not so close to zero. \n",

    "It should be noted that this exercise should be viewed with some skepticism (for a number of reasons but especially) due to the relatively naive way of fitting a trend. This being said there is no uncontroversial way of estimating trends. Furthermore, much more general and sophisticated empirical and theoretical approaches detect a systematic decline in productivity growth in the last decades. Understanding the reasons for the productivity growth decline is a hot topic of debate in economics, and you will learn about this during your studies, but further discussion is beyond the scope of this book.\n",

When plotting macroeconomic time-series it is common to explicitly visualize periods defined as recessions, and we show how to do this here.\n",

The only clearly visible difference seems to occur in the Covid recession where the two series seem slightly different in the quarters of largest drop and recovery, but even this is barely noticeable. Given that the quality of the approximation depends on the actual growth rate being small in absolute value, it is not surprising that the approximation performs worse exactly at times of extreme changes - however, even there it seems quite close to the actual.
