In the rest of the book, whenever new dataset is loaded we will explicitly print the first few rows of the data to clarify the structure. In R, this can be easily done by using the function `head()` which will print the first few rows of a dataframe. The syntax is `head(name_of_dataframe)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is often sufficient for the purposes of the book, when you use more complicated datasets it is better to view the data in the data browser, using the function `View()` with syntax `View(name_of_dataframe)` which will return the whole \"table\" of data.\n",
