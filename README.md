# Jupyter Notebooks for replicating codes in e-book in the cloud

This branch of the repo contains a set of 
- Jupyter Notebooks (containing the text and R codes from the book) 
- Excel files (containing data)
- Configuration files

to create a virtual environment via myBinder that allows you to replicate the codes from the book easily and without a local R installation.  

The virtual R installation with all necessary files is at 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/eekostadinov/Refresher/notebooks

To replicate a chapter of the book, open the above link in your browser (you may have to wait a while for the environment to be built but it should not be too slow). This will start a virtual jupyter-lab online environment in your browser. You will be able to see the files from the repository on the left of your screen. Then simply open one of the .ipynb files (one for each chapter) and run them in your browser (see specific instructions within the notebooks).
